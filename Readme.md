# Toy Robot Coding Challenge
<sup>Written By **John Oliver**

## Technical Notes
This solution was written using *Visual Studio 2015 Professional*.

The testing framework used is *xUnit* with *Specflow/Gherkin*.
Due to limitations of *Specflow* when using *Visual Studio 2015 Professional*, 
the version of the *Specflow* extension used is v2019.0.43 
(https://github.com/SpecFlowOSS/SpecFlow.VisualStudio/releases/tag/v2019.0.43).
Later versions of the *Specflow* software will not generate the feature code behind
files.  
This has resulted in limiting the version of *Specflow* to *Specflow 2*, rather than the 
latest *Specflow* version (currently version 3).
